# Who I Am
I’m currently a student at Virginia Commonwealth University learning mathematics. I learned development through various courses and self-learning curriculums such as Trailhead for Salesforce technologies.
I’m currently learning Java SE and Microsoft Azure; I am pursuing personal projects to both improve my portfolio and increase my knowledge of software development.
I’m looking to collaborate on any Java-related projects where I can hopefully contribute meanigfully while improving my understanding of the various technologies involved.

# Development Goals
- My goal is to become an extremely adept developer for both Java and Salesforce technologies (Apex, Visualforce).
- Long term goals include learning and specializing in specific types of development invollving Microsoft Azure.
